## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Set up the SQLite database for scheduled posts and implement the logging framework for debugging and monitoring application behavior.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Logging framework configured with both file and console handlers

- [x] #2 JSON storage file created with scheduled_posts containing id, provider, author, file_path, publish_at, status fields
- [x] #3 CLI command implemented to prune published posts from storage
- [x] #4 File locking mechanism prevents concurrent access issues

- [x] #5 CLI prune command supports filtering by date (prune posts published after/before a specific date)
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Review spec requirements for storage schema and logging
2. Design JSON storage format with required fields (id, provider, author, file_path, publish_at, status)
3. Implement storage.py with JSON file initialization and CRUD operations
4. Add file locking mechanism to prevent concurrent access issues
5. Set up Python logging framework with file and console handlers
6. Add CLI prune command with date filtering options (--before, --after flags)
7. Create unit tests for storage operations and date-filtered pruning
8. Verify all acceptance criteria are met
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented comprehensive storage and logging infrastructure for SocialCLI:

## Storage System
- Created JSON-based storage for scheduled posts in ~/.socialcli/scheduled_posts.json
- Implemented CRUD operations: create, read, update, delete for scheduled posts
- Added file locking mechanism using fcntl for concurrent access safety
- Schema includes: id, provider, author, file_path, publish_at, status, created_at, updated_at

## Logging Framework
- Configured Python logging with both file and console handlers
- Log files stored in ~/.socialcli/logs/socialcli.log
- Format: timestamp - name - level - message

## CLI Prune Command
- Implemented socialcli prune command with date filtering
- Supports --before and --after flags for date-based pruning
- Includes --dry-run flag to preview changes
- Default behavior: prune all published posts

## Testing
- Created 28 comprehensive unit tests covering:
  - Storage initialization and directory creation
  - CRUD operations for scheduled posts
  - Prune functionality with various date filters
  - File locking mechanism
  - Post and media storage
  - Logger configuration
- All tests passing

## Files Modified
- socialcli/core/storage.py: Added scheduled posts management and pruning
- socialcli/core/cli.py: Added prune command
- tests/core/test_storage.py: Created comprehensive test suite
