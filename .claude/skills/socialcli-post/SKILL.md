# SocialCLI LinkedIn Post Creator

This skill provides a complete end-to-end workflow for creating engaging LinkedIn posts, from initial idea to scheduled publication.

## When to Activate

Activate this skill when the user:
- Wants to create a LinkedIn post
- Wants to schedule a social media post
- Mentions posting to LinkedIn
- Asks about creating social media content
- Needs help writing professional content

## Complete Workflow

### Phase 1: Content Discovery & Strategy

**Understand the user's intent and goals:**

1. **Ask about the post purpose:**
   - What's the main topic or message?
   - What type of post? (announcement, insight, question, story, tutorial, etc.)
   - Who's the target audience?
   - What action do you want readers to take?

2. **Gather context:**
   - Any specific points to cover?
   - Links to share (blog, product, event)?
   - Tone preference (professional, casual, inspirational, educational)?
   - Any constraints (length, style, formality)?

### Phase 2: Content Creation & Refinement

**Help craft engaging content following LinkedIn best practices:**

1. **Structure the post:**
   - **Hook** (first 1-2 lines): Attention-grabbing opening
   - **Value** (body): Main content, insights, story, or information
   - **Call to Action** (ending): Engage readers, ask questions
   - **Hashtags** (3-5 recommended): Relevant and specific

2. **Optimize for LinkedIn:**
   - Keep it concise (1,300-2,000 characters optimal)
   - First 150 characters are crucial (preview text)
   - Use line breaks for readability
   - Add emojis strategically (not excessively)
   - Include relevant hashtags

3. **Draft and iterate:**
   - Present draft to user
   - Offer improvements based on:
     * Clarity and engagement
     * Professional tone
     * Call to action strength
     * Hashtag relevance
   - Refine based on user feedback

4. **Content guidelines to follow:**
   - Make first line compelling (people should want to click "see more")
   - Break text into short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)
   - Use storytelling when appropriate
   - Be authentic and valuable
   - End with a question or call to action

### Phase 3: Technical Details

**Once content is finalized, gather technical information:**

1. **Media files**: Whether they want to include images/media and their paths (optional)
2. **Scheduling**: When to publish (now or scheduled date/time) (optional)
3. **Visibility**: Public or connections only (optional, default: public)
4. **Tags**: Organizational tags for the post (optional)

### Phase 4: File Creation & Publishing

Generate a markdown file with the following structure:

```markdown
---
platform: linkedin
visibility: [public|connections]
schedule: [ISO 8601 format if scheduled, omit if posting now]
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
media:
  - /path/to/image1.jpg
  - /path/to/image2.png
---

[Post content text here]
```

**Important formatting rules:**
- Use YAML front matter (between `---` markers)
- Schedule format: ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS` for local time, add `Z` for UTC, or timezone offset like `-05:00`)
- Media paths must be absolute paths
- Tags are optional but helpful for organization
- Visibility defaults to `public` if not specified

### Phase 5: Save and Execute

1. Save the post file to a logical location (suggest `~/posts/` directory)
2. Use filename format: `linkedin-YYYY-MM-DD-brief-title.md`
3. Execute the socialcli command:
   - For immediate posting: `socialcli post --file <path>`
   - For scheduled posting: `socialcli post --file <path>` (schedule in front matter)

### Phase 6: Confirm Success & Schedule Comments

**Post Confirmation:**
- Show the user the created file path
- Display the socialcli command output
- Confirm whether the post was queued or published
- If scheduled, remind user about the scheduler daemon

**Comment Scheduling (Optional):**

After successfully creating the post, ask if the user wants to schedule comments:

1. **Ask about comments:**
   - "Would you like to schedule one or more comments on this post?"
   - "Comments can help boost engagement and keep the conversation going"

2. **If user wants comments, for each comment:**
   - Ask for the comment text
   - Ask for timing: "How long after the post should this comment be published?"
     * Accept input in seconds (e.g., "300s", "300 seconds") or minutes (e.g., "5m", "5 minutes")
     * Minimum delay: 5 minutes (300 seconds) from post publication time
     * Suggest common delays: 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours

3. **Create comment files:**
   - Save each comment to `~/posts/comments/` directory
   - Use filename format: `comment-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-parent-title.md`
   - Calculate absolute publish time: post_time + delay
   - Store parent post UUID for linking

4. **Execute comment scheduling:**
   - Use internal storage API (not direct CLI) to schedule comments
   - Each comment needs: provider, author, file_path, publish_at, parent_uuid
   - Confirm successful scheduling for each comment

**Comment File Format:**
```markdown
---
platform: linkedin
visibility: public
---

[Comment content text here]
```

**Important Comment Rules:**
- Comments must be scheduled at least 5 minutes AFTER the parent post
- Comments are linked to parent post via UUID (handled internally)
- Comments require the parent post to be published before they can be posted
- Comments use the same markdown format as posts (with front matter)
- Multiple comments can be scheduled for the same post

**Final Actions:**
- Offer to create another post or make modifications
- Remind about scheduler daemon if any scheduled items exist

Thanks for all the engagement! I'm planning a follow-up post on async testing strategies. What topics would you like me to cover? ü§î
```

**Files Created:**
- Post: `~/posts/linkedin-2025-10-25-python-async.md`
- Comment 1: `~/posts/comments/comment-2025-10-25-14-05-python-async.md`
- Comment 2: `~/posts/comments/comment-2025-10-25-14-30-python-async.md`
- Comment 3: `~/posts/comments/comment-2025-10-25-16-00-python-async.md`

**Implementation Notes:**
- Comments are scheduled using Python storage API directly (not CLI)
- Each comment is linked to the parent post via UUID
- Comment timing is calculated as: post_time + user_specified_delay
- All comments are validated to be at least 5 minutes after the post

## Important Notes

1. **Directory Setup**:
   - Suggest creating `~/posts/` directory if it doesn't exist
   - Suggest creating `~/posts/comments/` directory for comment files
2. **Scheduler**: Remind users that scheduled posts require the scheduler daemon to be running
3. **Authentication**: Ensure user has authenticated with `socialcli login` before posting
4. **Media Validation**: Verify media file paths exist before creating the post
5. **ISO 8601 Format**: Help users format dates correctly (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)
6. **Comment Timing**:
   - Comments must be at least 5 minutes after the parent post
   - Parse user input for delays: "5m", "5 minutes", "300s", "300 seconds"
   - Calculate absolute publish time: parent_post_time + delay
7. **Comment Storage**:
   - Comments are scheduled using Python's Storage API
   - Need to extract UUID from post creation response
   - Store parent_uuid, provider, author, file_path, and publish_at

## Error Handling

**Post-related errors:**
- Check if user is authenticated: `socialcli login`
- Verify file paths are correct
- Check front matter YAML syntax
- Ensure schedule time is in the future
- Validate media file paths exist

**Comment-related errors:**
- Ensure comment delay is at least 5 minutes
- Verify parent post was successfully created (has UUID)
- Check comment file creation and content
- Validate comment timing calculations
- Ensure Storage API is accessible for direct scheduling

## Quick Reference: Front Matter Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description | Default |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `platform` | string | Yes | Target platform | linkedin |
| `visibility` | string | No | Post visibility | public |
| `schedule` | datetime | No | When to publish (ISO 8601) | now |
| `tags` | list | No | Organization tags | [] |
| `media` | list | No | Media file paths | [] |
